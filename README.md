Project: Matrix reduction and operations through user input. 

I made this project on my own, aside from my computer science classes, out of my own personal interest.  

This program allows a user to create (both randomly and manually) m x n matrices, name them, store them, and perform many different operations on them. The matrices can be transformed to reduced row echelon form, can be added or multiplied together, and they can be printed in a variety of different ways. 

I implemented these operations through functions and list comprehension, although an object-oriented approach with classes would likely have been a more organized and modular appraoch. 

There is still much I could add to this project, such as solutions in vector form, determinants, inverse matrices, etc. These would not be very difficult to implement. 

To run the project, simply run the main.py file with the other files in the required folder and the capablities of the project will be demonstrated. 

As a double major in math and computer science, I was interested in automating what I was learning in my math classes and there is still a lot of ideas I have for this in the future.
